	    <p align="left">The DEFCON Ethics Village, is a one day ethics conference focused on the fostering a discussion about ethics in the security domain.  The discussion on ethics in the security domain has been present since its inception however, we want to foster a greater discussion on ethics across all security domains. We want to celebrate the mistakes and grow as a community. <br />
	      <br />

	      We want to learn what ethical situations arise for security professionals. We want to learn how security professionals handle these situations. We want to know about times you stood up to your boss because of your ethical beliefs to when you did something completely unethical and possibly broke the law. <br />
	      <br />

We are seeking submissions: talks, case studies, confessions, and panels.

<h4>Asking for a friend</h4>
Asking for a friend are presentations where people can talk about ethical dilemmas that have occurred in their lives that they would like to share with the community. These talks can be done as anonymously as possible. <br />
<br />
<h4>Case studies</h4> presentation provide a means of presenting stories that address particular security phenomena, in particular we hope these case studies deal with futuristic possibilities that may or may have already occurred. Case studies are compelling stories about futuristic-based scenarios and security. A case study should describe the problem, explain the many viewpoints this case study faces, and provide insights into possible solutions. <br />
<br />
<b>An example: ByteCoinz Bubble</b> <br />
<em>You have created a popular cryptocurrency, and you know it's value is blown out of proportion by media hype. You own a lot of this currency because you used it before it was cool. People are betting their life's savings on your currency. Criminals are using your currency to launder and transfer money. Citizens of a poor country are using your currency to buy food in a hyper-inflated economy. You created your currency to be the fastest and most secure currency in existence. You honestly believe that it is and that it offers other benefits such as anonymity and decentralization as well. You are aware, however, that the current market value is substantially inflated above what the currency is objectively worth. Some famous investors are warning that your currency value is a bubble set to pop, but the fact that they don’t fully understand the technology causes many investors to ignore their advice. You have been invited to give a TV interview about your creation for a major television network. You could truthfully focus on the good-tell the truth about the benefits of the currency and probably increase your personal wealth. Alternately, you could focus on the inflation aspect, which could be considered more honest or “full disclosure,” but it could cost you money.</em><br />

		<h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">This year at DEFCON 26, we hope to host talks and discussion panels on the role of ethics in various security domains (e.g., vulnerability disclosure, incident response, digital forensics, security education, smart cars, IoT) and related topics. We intend to invite presentations from speakers with a wide variety of backgrounds in order to receive diverse perspectives. The goal of this village is to initiate a conversation among the security community in the hopes that it will foster a better understanding of the ethical questions we face as a community.</h3>
