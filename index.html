	    <br />
	    <p align="left">The DEFCON Ethics Village, is a ethics conference focused on the fostering a discussion about ethics in the security domain.  The discussion on ethics in the security domain has been present since its inception however, we want to foster a greater discussion on ethics across all security domains. We want to celebrate the mistakes and grow as a community. <br />
	      <br />

	      We want to learn what ethical situations arise for security professionals. We want to learn how security professionals handle these situations. We want to know about times you stood up to your boss because of your ethical beliefs to when you did something completely unethical and possibly broke the law. <br />
	      <br />

	      The Ethics Village is sponsorsed by <a href="https://bigezy.github.io//">DC 217</a> an interest group for computer security topics.<br />

	    <h3>Talks</h3>
	  <p>Talks are the standard presentation style, with slides, and where we hope you (or you all) enlighten, education, and inspire the audience on an interesting topic or project. Potential Topics: security & socio-technical computer ethics, technological bias in system design, professional responsibility, hacking back, and vulnerability disclosure.</p>

<h3>Case studies</h3>
<p>Case study-based presentations provide a means of presenting stories that address particular security phenomena, in particular we hope these case studies deal with futuristic possibilities that may or may have already occurred. Case studies are compelling stories about security. A case study should describe the problem, explain the many viewpoints this case study faces, and provide insights into possible solutions.</p>

<h3>Panels</h3>
<p>Panels bring a focus on lively, controversial and provocative discussion on a specific topic of interest to the community. Panel sessions do not consist of paper presentations, but should insight plenty of discussion engaging the audience.</p>

<h3>Demos</h3>
<p>Demos is a demonstration of an ethical/non-ethical technology. The presenter will use most of the time to display a working technology, in real time, and will display/discuss with the audience about the ethical implications.</p>

<h3>Asking for a friend</h3>
<p>Asking for a friend are presentations where people can talk about ethical dilemmas that have occurred in their lives that they would like to share with the community. Feel free to stop by the assigned time-slot during the Ethics Village to discuss openly with the community or submit anonymously below.</p>

		<h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">At DEFCON, we hope to host talks, discussions, demos and panels on the role of ethics in various security domains (e.g., vulnerability disclosure, incident response, digital forensics, security education, smart cars, IoT) and related topics. We intend to invite presentations from speakers with a wide variety of backgrounds in order to receive diverse perspectives. The goal of this village is to initiate a conversation among the security community in the hopes that it will foster a better understanding of the ethical questions we face as a community.</h3>
